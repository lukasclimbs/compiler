### Compiler (eventually)
=======================
# My name is Lukas Alden Resch! 

This repository is for my compiler, which I am building as part of my CSC312 class at Grinnell College. There's not a lot currently, but there's an interesting (though basic) echo-like program called repeat.

If you have ocaml installed on your machine, the only necessary steps should be to call 'make' in the command-line from the same directory. You can then run by calling './repeat.native {args}'. You can call the test suite by calling './tests.sh' though you may have to call 'chmod +x ./tests.sh.'


# Assignment 1
-features an echo-like program called repeat.
-There is also a test suite for the program called tests.sh (see above for instructions on both).
-There are currently no known bugs.
